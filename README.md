### What I learned

HTML and CSS, the core languages of the web, were the subject of my first actual coding experience.  Learning HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, was similar to learning the framework of a webpage, which specifies the locations of headings, paragraphs, and graphics.  The difficulty soon shifted from deciding which pieces to utilize to figuring out how to properly arrange them to produce a page that is both clear and semantic.

 That structure was then given life by CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets.  All of a sudden, I had power over layouts, colors, and typefaces, turning an ordinary HTML document into something eye-catching.  Understanding the "cascading" element—how several styles interact and supersede one another—was the first challenge..
